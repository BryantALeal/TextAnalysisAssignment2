# TextAnalysisAssignment2
A repo for code used for completing project 2 in Text Analysis where we were to analyze user sentiment on beer reviews from <a href='https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/'> Beer Advocate's </a> top 250 beers.  <br>
The code is split off into different sections that I will describe in detail below:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Webscraper</li>
  The webscraper uses a combination of two packages, Selenium and Beautiful Soup. Both of these were used because of their individual benefits. For example, Beauitful Soup makes parsing through HTML easily. This enabled us to parse 
  <li>Word Frequency Analysis</li>
  <li>Cosine Similarity</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
  <li>Evaluation Score</li>
  <li>Spacy Simliarity</li>
  <li>Analysis of Results</li>

</ol>
